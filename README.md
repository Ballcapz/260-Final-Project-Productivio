# 260-Final-Project-Productivio

This software tracks cpu/ram usage, has a todo list tab, a tab to save important dates,
and a money flow tab to track earning and spending.

Ideas for improvement:
1. Add each object to the database rather than a set of values.

2. Make it an Azure hosted database so the application becomes scalable.
